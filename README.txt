DAY 1:

This is an addition to the README.txt file.

The next thing is to commit this change to the repository

So I have successfully pushed a commit to the remote git.

This is rocks [that better explains how excited I am].

Wait until I become a PRO!!!

DAY 2:

I can feel it...I am gradually becoming a super GIT PRO.

This was added from test branch...
